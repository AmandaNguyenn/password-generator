# password-generator

## Purpose

For this project we were asked to create a random password generator using the skills we learned this week. This week we learned conditional statements, variables, arrays, functions, scopes, objects, and methods.

For this project, we were provided some prebuilt code, but we were asked to fill in missing Javascript.
